    <p id="passage" class="intro">There are dozens of night markets in Taiwan, but not all are the same. Some night markets are better than others, so if you have limited time in Taiwan, it's important to choose the right one. Night markets are similar to opening a gift in that you can find a lot of food and games there to see, eat, and have fun. </p>
